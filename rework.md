### Rugged living meme
- Medium impact
- Start with research: pemmican
- Rough living: welcomed
- Temperature: tough
- Comfort: ignored
- Fungus: don't care
- Barracks: preferred
- Autonomous weapons: despised
- - mood debuffs for using autonomous weapons (-6 mood "we shouldn't rest on our laurels" or something)

The idea is to remove some of the early-game debuffs related to resource scarcity in exchange for debuffing late-game conveniences. Should also improve caravan morale and make nomadic playthroughs more viable.

### Rework collectivist
- Global work speed: +4%

Individualist doesn't do much at all compared to collectivist, which triples work drive duration. I'd like to revisit these under an autocratic/liberal lens. The idea being autocratic ideologies promote productivity and liberal ideologies promote creativity.

### Rework individualist
- Art quality: +25%
- Opinion buffs for artists?

### Rework supremacist
- Charity: abhorrent
- Mood buffs for ignoring charity requests
- Mood buffs for harming charity seekers
- Mood debuffs for completing charity requests

Supremacist is already OP, this would make it slightly more OP.

### Rework loyalist
- Maybe rebalance it around VIE's nationalist meme?
- Charity: disapproved
- Mood debuffs for completing charity requests

Loyalist is a weird middle-ground between guilty and supremacist that doesn't really do anything at all. I'd like to flesh it out.

### Rework gender supremacy
- suborinate genders can now be specialists but not leader or moral guide
