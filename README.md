# ideology expansion
Scope of this mod:
- Add new memes, precepts, styles and other content requiring Rimworld - Ideology
- Rework memes, precepts, styles, and other content requiring Rimworld - Ideology

Bloat removal should be done by [fried rice](https://github.com/boomersama/boomer.patches) so any additional changes can be built upon by this mod.

## Additions
Rugged living is being rewritten, so this mod currently adds nothing.

## Changes
### Individualist
- Prevents drug use: prohibited
- Prevents lovin: spouse only (moderate, strict), horrible, and prohibited
### Loyalist
- Requires apostasy: abhorrent and horrible
### Proselytizer
- Moved to low impact
### Tree connection
- Renamed to gauranlen connection
- Removes trees: desired requirement to focus the meme on gauranlen mechanics

## To-do:
### Add rugged living meme
- Medium impact
- Start with research: pemmican
- Rough living: welcomed
- Temperature: tough
- Comfort: ignored
- Fungus: don't care
- Barracks: preferred
- Autonomous weapons: despised
- - mood debuffs for using autonomous weapons (-6 mood "we shouldn't rest on our laurels" or something)

The idea is to remove some of the early-game debuffs related to resource scarcity in exchange for debuffing late-game conveniences. Should also improve caravan morale.

### Rework collectivist
- Global work speed: +4%

Individualist doesn't do much at all compared to collectivist, which triples work drive duration. I'd like to revisit these under an autocratic/liberal lens. The idea being autocratic ideologies promote productivity and liberal ideologies promote creativity.

### Rework individualist
- Art quality: +25%
- Opinion buffs for artists?

### Rework supremacist
- Charity: abhorrent
- Mood buffs for ignoring charity requests
- Mood buffs for harming charity seekers
- Mood debuffs for completing charity requests

Supremacist is already OP, this would make it slightly more OP.

### Rework loyalist
- Maybe rebalance it around VIE's nationalist meme?
- Charity: disapproved
- Mood debuffs for completing charity requests

Loyalist is a weird middle-ground between guilty and supremacist that doesn't really do anything at all. I'd like to flesh it out.

### Rework gender supremacy
- suborinate genders can now be specialists but not leader or moral guide
